# Cinewise - Movie Recommendation Using Graph Theory

Recommend movies based on user's preferred movies, genres, actors, directors and storywriters.

This project implements the first two algorithms from a [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6621363) published in IEEE Xplore:

-   Union Colors - a combination of multisource 'breadth first search' (BFS) and union-find data structure.
-   Energy Spread - a variation of multisource breadth first search.

The explanation for these algorithms can be found in the paper. Credits for the same go to the respective authors.

I have created a Django application around the algorithm for a smooth experience. Bootstrap is used for creating a simple yet elegant frontpage.

## The Graph

The graph has movie titles, genres and the assoicated directors, actors and story writers as the vertices. These vertices are mutually connected for every movie.

## OMDB API

We used [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to obtain movie information and create a graph around it. The data is stored using serialization. (movies.pickle, node.pickle and graph.pickle)

## Configuration

You need to manually add the movie attributes in the database for autocompletion. Rest of the steps are the same as any other Django project.

-   Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jainam2385/Movie-Recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation
cd recommendation
```

-   Install the required packages. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

-   Create a file to store your environment variables for python-decouple to give them at the right places.

```sh
nano .env
```

```
DEBUG=""
OMDB_API_KEY=""
APIKEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""
```

-   If you're not going to use a PostgreSQL database, change the DATABASES variable in mysite/settings.py accordingly. Refer [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/databases/) for that.

-   If you're going to play with movie related information, you can obtain your API key from OMDB website [here](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Otherwise keep it blank.

-   `DEBUG=True` for development and `False` for production.

-   Make the initial migrations

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Here's the 'different' part:**

-   Open the Django shell:

```sh
python manage.py shell
```

-   Add the vertices:

```py
from utils.Movies import *
from cinewise.models import Node
nodes = load_nodes()
for node in nodes:
    Node(name=node).save()
```
